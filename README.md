# learning-bayesian-analysis
This repository contains code that I wrote while learning how to apply Bayesian techniques for statistical inference. Have used MCMC techniques for parameter estimation even when analytical solutions may have been tractable. This was done for learning purposes.

What has been done so far:
* A simple MCMC simulation to estimate the parameters of a biased coin
* Used the titanic dataset to model for the chances of survival as a function of age. Compared the results for MCMC with glm output. Same model resulted in both cases

Next steps:
* Simulate a simple hidden markov process to generate some data, then use this data to estimate the original HMM parameters
